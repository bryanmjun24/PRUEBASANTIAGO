        <p class="description">First of all, Encebollado is a typical dish of the Ecuadorian coast, especially popular in the Guayas and Manab√≠ region. It is considered an icon of Ecuadorian gastronomy and is widely appreciated for its comforting flavor and revitalizing properties, frequently being consumed as a hangover remedy. </p>
        <h3 style="color: #2c3e50; text-align: left;">Origins: </h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The origin of encebollado dates back to the pre-Columbian coastal communities of Ecuador, where indigenous peoples already prepared soups with fish that are the basis of the traditional dish that with the arrival of the Spanish grew in variety so other ingredients were introduced such as onion and lemon, and the recipe ended up evolving until it became one of the most popular dishes in Ecuador, even ranking among the top fish soups in the world.</p>

                <p>My relationship with this dish begins at a very early age where the whole family would go to eat this delicious food. Years have passed and it is still my favorite dish, perhaps for the same fact that it reminds me of what everything was like when I was a child. Or maybe its flavor and that despite being a very well-known dish in Ecuador, each person, place or restaurant prepares it in a different way and makes it unique in their own way, so you can try it again and again and it will always have a different flavor. familiar but not the same. It is a dish that I miss and although I like to cook I have never done it because I think that if I learn it, I will end up doing it very often and maybe it will take away from the magic that I find in it. For me it is a dish that reminds me of my family, of sharing time together and how delicious the food of my country is.</p>

        <p class="description">To finish I want to tell the story about the photo below, one day when I was about 22 years old or so I decided that I wanted to have lunch with onions for a whole week but I also decided that every day I would do it in a different place with a different person and well I did it. and it was a week that I will never forget because it is not only the dish but also the sharing with my friends and family. </p>
